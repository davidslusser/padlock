Configuration
=============

Database
^^^^^^^^
PadLock works with SqLite out of the box but can be configured to use MySQL or Postgress (or other databases) by updating the database section of the settings.py file.


Logging
^^^^^^^



Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Local django authentication is available by default in PadLock. Other authentication backends (such as ldap) can be configured in the settings.py file.
